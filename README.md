# Isometric Transforms for Illustrator

A script for performing SSR (Scale, Shear, Rotate) transforms on Illustrator to create "isometric" drawings.

### Install

Place the `.jsx` and the `/assets` folder into the directory `path_to_illustrator_install/Presets/en_US/Scripts`. Then you're good to go!

### Usage

In Illustrator, select what you want to transform. Select `File > Scripts > IsometricTransform.jsx` and a menu will pop up, with four options: one for each side, with two for the top (since there are two ways to transform toward the top panel). Select which transform you want, and that's it!
